Its robust features make it well-suited for handling complex data analysis tasks and building scalable solutions for varying business needs.
- The most widely used databases today are `MySQL, Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,` and `MongoDB`. The desired database in the next few years tends to be the same as the database that is currently used. In other words, data professionals are satisfied with their current choice of database and see it as the preferred option for their future needs as well. This suggests a level of stability and confidence in the chosen database technology within the data analysis community.
- Then, the most widely used platforms today are `Windows, Linux, Docker, AWS,` and `Android`. The desired platform in the next few years tends to be the same as the platform currently used. The implications are generally similar like databases.
- For Web Frames, the most used today are `jQuery, ASP.NET, Angular, React.js,` and `Django`. Another Web Frame that will be desired in the next few years is `Vue.js`.
    - `Vue.js` is expected to be desired by data analysts in the future due to its lightweight and flexible nature, ease of integration with existing projects, growing community support, and its capability to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces efficiently.

- Demographic characteristics such as formal education level, major, non-degree education, age, and salary are generally similar between data analysts and other IT professionals surveyed.

<br>

### Salary Comparison Using Tech Skill(s)

Finally, for a data analyst, the total number of IT skills mastered or the use of certain IT skills does not affect the amount of annual salary that will be earned. While it may appear that possessing numerous technical skills enhances one's value and competency, this finding suggests that several other variables exhibit a more substantial correlation with the annual salary.
Therefore, there are other aspects that are likely to have a greater influence on the annual salary that a data analyst earns.
